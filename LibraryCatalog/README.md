# Overview

As part of my continued growth as a software engineer, I developed a console-based Library Catalog System using the C# programming language. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming, file I/O operations, and C# syntax fundamentals such as variables, conditionals, loops, classes, and structures.

The goal of this software is to simulate a simple library system where users can add books, search for them by title, view the full catalog, and save/load data to and from a file. This hands-on experience reinforced my knowledge of how to structure C# programs and work with both classes and data persistence through file handling.

Through this project, I learned how to implement reusable components, organize code into logical modules, and use C#'s `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` classes for file management.
